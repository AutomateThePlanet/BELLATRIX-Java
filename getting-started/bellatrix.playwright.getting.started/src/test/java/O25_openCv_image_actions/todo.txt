    1. Take a screenshot of the place on the screen that you want to perform actions on
    2. Convert the image to a base 64 format with an online tool
    3. Create an enum implementing the Base64Encodable interface
    4. Add the base 64 string, the name of the image and the offsets to the enum - check example enum: EncodedImageDemo
       (Note) If the x and y offsets are set to 0 -> it will take the coordinates of the center of the picture
    5. Create ActionImage component using the ImageBase64FindStrategy and passing the enum as an argument
